[26.12.2025 15:18:44] ~Wenfang: Can I also ask where you recommend to live in Fethiye? We are booking the Airbnb for these days but all the hosts ask us to pay in cash only, we are not sure if because we book the wrong area😂

[26.12.2025 15:18:59] Sky Fethiye: Thanks for asking. We specialize in activities and reservations, so we’re not able to recommend accommodation or comment on Airbnb host payment policies. If you need help with your paragliding booking (date, time, extras), I’m happy to assist. If you’d like, I can also arrange a call from our representative—would you like a call?
